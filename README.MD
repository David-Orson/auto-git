This is a basic project where I am learning to live in the terminal.

The goal is to first learn how to achieve the same goals that I can do with a GUI like windows and VSC, then to be able to automate much of these processes.
Lastly I would like to automate the building and tearing down of external development environments and infrastructure. 

I am currently writing this in nano, with the intention of switching to VIM soon, I also am following resources in the terminal by using the w3m package.
