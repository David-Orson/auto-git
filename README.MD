This is a basic project where I am learning to live in the terminal.

The goal is to first learn how to achieve the same goals that I can do with a GUI like windows and VSC, then to be able to automate much of these processes.
Lastly I would like to automate the building and tearing down of external development environments and infrastructure. 

I am currently writing this in nano, with the intention of switching to VIM soon, I also am following resources in the terminal by using the w3m package.

I have added the github cli to my wsl ubuntu terminal and configured the path so that I can interact efficiently with the github cli.
I created a repo and pushed this readme there. So far, all work has been done in the terminal but some I have looked at resources with chrome.
